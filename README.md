************************************INSTALLATION ************************************************

***********************************PORTABLE EDITION**********************************************
The jar file reqires no installation. However for running the jar you will require 
oracle's java runtime environment (jre) on your system.

Just unzip the file.
Go to JSicky/dist folder you will find the JSicky.jar file. 
Now run the jar file by doble clicking. 

Windows users can use the StartEliteComixReader.bat file to execute the jar file directly.
It is in the JSicky/dist folder.

If you want to create your own batch file :
Go to JSicky/dist folder where you will find the JSicky.jar file. 
create a new document start.bat and include the following line to it:
start java -jar JSicky.jar

create a shortcut to the Start.bat file by rightClicking the Start.bat file then choose create shortcut.
now copy the shortcut to your desktop.

If it dosen't run :
go to commnd prompt and use the follwing command :
cd directory/where/you/have/your/jre7/bin

for instance : C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin is the default place.

now type java -jar folder/where/you/extracted/the/project/JSicky/dist/JSicky.jar


I know its too much of a pain. I promise i will come up with a better method soon.
Keep checking http://sourceforge.net/projects/elitecomixread/ for updates.
